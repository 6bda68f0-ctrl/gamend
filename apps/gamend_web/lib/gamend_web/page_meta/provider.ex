  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for the host module that supplies per-page SEO metadata.

      config :gamend_web, page_meta_provider: MyHost.PageMeta

  The copy on a page is the host's, not core's, so this is a seam rather than
  a setting. Every callback is optional: a host that only wants descriptions
  implements `describe/1` and nothing else.

  `GamendWeb.PageMeta` holds the mechanics a provider builds on — normalising
  the path, trimming a description to what a search engine shows, turning a
  breadcrumb trail into `BreadcrumbList` markup.

  The contract used to live in `GamendWeb.Plugs.PageMeta`'s moduledoc, with the
  plug probing each function by name at request time. It still probes, because
  it must: a release loads modules lazily, so a provider may not be loaded the
  first time a page is served. Declaring the behaviour does not remove the
  check — it gives the check something to be checked against, and a host that
  misspells a callback now hears about it at compile time.
